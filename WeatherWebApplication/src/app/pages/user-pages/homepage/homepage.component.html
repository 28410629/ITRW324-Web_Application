            We, the Anchormen team, have identified a problem with weather services available today, the problem
            being that they prove to be not detailed enough for weather enthuasiasts interested. Due
            to weather stations being expensive, we have developed our own solution.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Anchormentstations is a open-source, community driven project for creating your own cheap weather station
            units, using our free tools developed for our users. This allows users to view station readings from
            their favourite stations, being their own or other users.</p>
